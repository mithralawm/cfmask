This project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project.

The CFmask project is a C version of the Fmask cloud algorithm developed by Zhe Zhu at Boston University.  The application uses Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance products as inputs and generates a separate output file which contains a mask designating clear, water, cloud, cloud shadow, and snow pixels.

A separate application is available within this project which appends the cfmask band to the user specified surface reflectance product.
